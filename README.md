# mobileye_project_integration
The purpose of this project is to detect traffic lights from a moving camera (also tell if the light is green or red) and estimates the distance from it.  
# First step: detect candidates  
with Image Processing, using technologies: numPy, OpenCV.  
# Second step: filter the traffic lights  
with Neural Network Model (which we trained with a dataset we created), using technologies: Tensorflow.  
# Third step: estimate distance  
with Structure of Motion (Ego Motion and vector direction provided)
